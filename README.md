> This is a template for my future projects graphQL. If you need to create a new graphQL project with TS, you can use my template. This is the first version, in weeks or days i will add new features, docker and docker-compose configuration for the api/postgresql.

I used Node/Typescript for this.

### About the app

### ORM config for your database

in the ormconfig.json

```tsx
{
    "type": "postgres", //your database system
    "host": "localhost", //host of your database
    "port": 5432,//port of your database
    "username": "postgres", 
//your username of your database, always is "postgres"
    "password": "", //your database password, always is ""
    "database": "templategql", //the name of your database
    "synchronize": true, //this is the sinchronization of typeorm
    "logging": true, 
/*logger of console, if you dont need see the the creation of tables or 
	any info of your db set this in **false***/
    "entities": ["src/entities/*.*"] //entities ubication
}
```

### Resolvers path configuration

In the `src/index.ts` you will find the code of resolvers path:

```tsx
const schema = await buildSchema({
      resolvers: [__dirname + "/modules/**/*.ts"],
    });

/*This code is for the path of resolvers. If you dont like this method
	of the set the path of all resolvers, you can use the method of
	imports. IMPORTANT if you will use the method of imports you will
	imports all resolvers and set in the resolvers.*/

example of imports:
import {IndexResolver} from './modules/IndexResolver';
import {ExampleResolver} from './modules/ExampleResolver';

const schema = await buildSchema({
	resolvers: [IndexResolver, ExampleResolver]
});

```
